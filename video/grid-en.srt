I promised you that if I ever got any information about your dad,

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
I'd tell you first - right?

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
I was paged last night. 'Came from your Dad's office at the arcade.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,000

Two nights before he disappeared he came to my house.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,700
He wouldn't have left you!

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Allan - you're acting like I'm going to find him sitting there working...

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
"Hey, kiddo. Lost track of time."

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wouldn't that be something.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,000
Dad?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Sam?

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
'Long time.

18
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,600
You have no idea.
